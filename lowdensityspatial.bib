@article{Tibon2015,
abstract = {The cognitive events examined in many event-related potentials (ERPs) studies do not occur in a neural vacuum, and separating the signals of interest from the brain's background electrical activity generally requires averaging multiple EEG segments of a condition of interest (Luck, 2005). In addition to within-subject averaging, the vast majority of ERP studies are based on across-subject grand average data, i.e., group waveforms representing the means of subjects' averaged waveforms, with statistical significance examined by comparing variance between conditions of interest with variance between participants. Using this approach may not always portray a valid picture. Consider, for example, the following experimental paradigm: in a study of episodic associative memory, participants encoded 120 pairs of stimuli (unrelated object picture pairs in the unimodal task, and unrelated environmental sound-object picture pairs in the crossmodal task). At test, cue pictures were presented to probe recall of the associated picture (in the unimodal task) or sound (in the crossmodal task). ERPs were time-locked to the onset of the cue, and sorted post-hoc into recall-success and recall-failure trials (for details of the procedures, see Tibon and Levy, 2014a). This experimental design poses several challenges to the conventional grand-averaging method. First, since the assignment of trials to experimental conditions is based on participants' responses, it is quite likely that the data will be unbalanced (that is, an unequal number of trials in each condition). Therefore, signal-to-noise ratio and variance can vary significantly between experimental conditions. Second, since experimental conditions are mutually dependent (i.e., a participant who had 100 recall-success responses can only have 20 recall-failure responses), participants who were very successful (having a low number of recall-failure trials) or very unsuccessful (having a low number of recall-success trials) in performing the task are likely to be excluded due to an insufficient number of trials for addressing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) challenges in one of the experimental conditions.

ABSTRACT={In the previous decade, breakthroughs in the central nervous system bioinformatics and computational innovation have prompted significant developments in brain–computer interface (BCI), elevating it to the forefront of applied science and research. BCI revitalization enables neurorehabilitation strategies for physically disabled patients (e.g., disabled patients and hemiplegia) and patients with brain injury (e.g., patients with stroke). Different methods have been developed for electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI applications. Due to the lack of a large set of EEG data, methods using matrix factorization and machine learning were the most popular. However, things have changed recently because a number of large, high-quality EEG datasets are now being made public and used in deep learning-based BCI applications. On the other hand, deep learning is demonstrating great prospects for solving complex relevant tasks such as motor imagery classification, epileptic seizure detection, and driver attention recognition using EEG data. Researchers are doing a lot of work on deep learning-based approaches in the BCI field right now. Moreover, there is a great demand for a study that emphasizes only deep learning models for EEG-based BCI applications. Therefore, we introduce this study to the recent proposed deep learning-based approaches in BCI using EEG data (from 2017 to 2022). The main differences, such as merits, drawbacks, and applications are introduced. Furthermore, we point out current challenges and the directions for future studies. We argue that this review study will help the EEG research community in their future research.}

ABSTRACT = {Background: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is becoming more reliable, thanks to the advantages of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recently, hybrid Deep Learning (hDL), which combines different DL algorithms, has gained momentum over the past five years. In this work, we proposed a review on hDL-based BCI starting from the seminal studies in 2015. Objectives: We have reviewed 47 papers that apply hDL to the BCI system published between 2015 and 2020 extracting trends and highlighting relevant aspects to the topic. Methods: We have queried four scientific search engines (Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore and Elsevier Science Direct) and different data items were extracted from each paper such as the database used, kind of application, online/offline training, tasks used for the BCI, pre-processing methodology adopted, type of normalization used, which kind of features were extracted, type of DL architecture used, number of layers implemented and which optimization approach were used as well. All these items were then investigated one by one to uncover trends. Results: Our investigation reveals that Electroencephalography (EEG) has been the most used technique. Interestingly, despite the lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the EEG data that makes pre-processing of that data mandatory, we have found that the pre-processing has only been used in 21.28% of the cases by showing that hDL seems to be able to overcome this intrinsic drawback of the EEG data. Temporal-features seem to be the most effective with 93.94% accuracy, while spatial-temporal features are the most used with 33.33% of the cases investigated. The most used architecture has been Convolutional Neural Network-Recurrent Neural Network CNN-RNN with 47% of the cases. Moreover, half of the studies have used a low number of layers to achieve a good compromise between the complexity of the network and computational efficiency. Significance: To give useful information to the scientific community, we make our summary table of hDL-based BCI papers available and invite the community to published work to contribute to it directly. We have indicated a list of open challenges, emphasizing the need to use neuroimaging techniques other than EEG, such as functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), deeper investigate the advantages and disadvantages of using pre-processing and the relationship with the accuracy obtained. To implement new combinations of architectures, such as RNN-based and Deep Belief Network DBN-based, it is necessary to better explore the frequency and temporal-frequency features of the data at hand.},

ABSTRACT = {Motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have shown increased potential for the rehabilitation of stroke patients; nonetheless, their implementation in clinical practice has been restricted due to their low accuracy performance. To date, although a lot of research has been carried out in benchmarking and highlighting the most valuable classification algorithms in BCI configurations, most of them use offline data and are not from real BCI performance during the closed-loop (or online) sessions. Since rehabilitation training relies on the availability of an accurate feedback system, we surveyed articles of current and past EEG-based BCI frameworks who report the online classification of the movement of two upper limbs in both healthy volunteers and stroke patients. We found that the recently developed deep-learning methods do not outperform the traditional machine-learning algorithms. In addition, patients and healthy subjects exhibit similar classification accuracy in current BCI configurations. Lastly, in terms of neurofeedback modality, functional electrical stimulation (FES) yielded the best performance compared to non-FES systems.},

abstract = {In this work, a brain–computer interface (BCI) system for character recognition has been proposed based on the P300 signal. P300 signal classification is the most challenging task in electroencephalography signal processing as it is affected by the surrounding noise and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Feature extraction and feature selection are essential steps for any classification task. Most of the earlier techniques reported hand-crafted features for detection of P300 signal. However, the hand-crafted features are not efficient to represent the signal properly due to surrounding environment and subject variability. Motivated by this, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been proposed for automatic high-level feature extraction to detect P300 signal. In general, CNN model consists of convolutional and fully-connected layers followed by a softmax layer. In the developed system, two different convolutional layers are used to extract the spatial and temporal features from the dataset. Also, a 2D convolutional layer based CNN architecture has been proposed where spatio-temporal feature is extracted in a single layer. To mitigate the over-fitting problem, dropout is employed in CNN architecture, which improves the network performance. After extracting high-level features, Fisher ratio (F-ratio) based feature selection is proposed to find the optimal features. The optimal features are used in the ensemble of support vector machine (ESVM) classifier for P300 detection. ESVM has been adopted in this work to minimize the classifier variability. The models are tested on two widely used datasets, and the experimental results show better or comparable performance compared to the earlier reported techniques.}

abstract = {Background
Incorporating the time-frequency localization properties of Gabor transform (GT), the complexity understandings of convolutional neural network (CNN), and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) efficacy in distinguishing positive peaks can exhibit their characteristics to reveal an effective solution in the detection of P300 evoked related potential (ERP). By applying a drastic number of convolutional layers, the majority of deep networks elicit sufficient properties for the output determination, leading to gigantic and time-consuming structures. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework by the combination of tuned GT, and modified HOG with the CNN as “TGT-MHOG-CNN” for detection of P300 ERP in EEG signal.
Method
In the proposed method, GT is tuned based on triangular function for EEG signals, and then spectrograms including time-frequency information are captured. The function's parameters are justified to differentiate the signals with the P300 component. Furthermore, HOG is modified (MHOG) for the 2-D EEG signal, and consequently, gradients patterns are extracted for the target potentials. MHOG is potent in distinguishing the positive peak in the general waveform; however, GT unravels time-frequency information, which is ignored in the gradient histogram. These outputs of GT and MHOG do not share the same nature in the images nor overlap. Therefore, more extensive information is reached without redundancy or excessive information by fusing them. Combining GT and MHOG provides different patterns which benefit CNN for more precise detection. Consequently, TGT-MHOG-CNN ends in a more straightforward structure than other networks, and therefore, the whole performance is acceptable with faster rates and very high accuracy.
Results
BCI Competition II and III datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. These datasets include a complete record for P300 ERP with BCI2000 using a paradigm, and it has numerous noises, including power and muscle-based noises. The objective is to predict the correct character in each provided character selection epochs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, simulation results indicate striking abilities of the proposed framework for P300 ERP detection. Our best record reached the P300 ERP classification rates of over 98.7% accuracy and 98.7% precision for BCI Competition II and 99% accuracy and 100% precision for BCI Competition III datasets, with superiority in execution time for the mentioned datasets.}

abstract = {The classification of hyperspectral image is a challenging task due to the high dimensional space, with large number of spectral bands, and low number of labeled training samples. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel methodology for hyperspectral image classification based on multi-view deep neural networks which fuses both spectral and spatial features by using only a small number of labeled samples. Firstly, we process the initial hyperspectral image in order to extract a set of spectral and spatial features. Each spectral vector is the spectral signature of each pixel of the image. The spatial features are extracted using a simple deep autoencoder, which seeks to reduce the high dimensionality of data taking into account the neighborhood region for each pixel. Secondly, we propose a multi-view deep autoencoder model which allows fusing the spectral and spatial features extracted from the hyperspectral image into a joint latent representation space. Finally, a semi-supervised graph convolutional network is trained based on thee fused latent representation space to perform the hyperspectral image classification. The main advantage of the proposed approach is to allow the automatic extraction of relevant information while preserving the spatial and spectral features of data, and improve the classification of hyperspectral images even when the number of labeled samples is low. Experiments are conducted on three real hyperspectral images respectively Indian Pines, Salinas, and Pavia University datasets. Results show that the proposed approach is competitive in classification performances compared to state-of-the-art.}

ABSTRACT={The 2020's decade will likely witness an unprecedented development and deployment of neurotechnologies for human rehabilitation, personalized use, and cognitive or other enhancement. New materials and algorithms are already enabling active brain monitoring and are allowing the development of biohybrid and neuromorphic systems that can adapt to the brain. Novel brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been proposed to tackle a variety of enhancement and therapeutic challenges, from improving decision-making to modulating mood disorders. While these BCIs have generally been developed in an open-loop modality to optimize their internal neural decoders, this decade will increasingly witness their validation in closed-loop systems that are able to continuously adapt to the user's mental states. Therefore, a proactive ethical approach is needed to ensure that these new technological developments go hand in hand with the development of a sound ethical framework. In this perspective article, we summarize recent developments in neural interfaces, ranging from neurohybrid synapses to closed-loop BCIs, and thereby identify the most promising macro-trends in BCI research, such as simulating vs. interfacing the brain, brain recording vs. brain stimulation, and hardware vs. software technology. Particular attention is devoted to central nervous system interfaces, especially those with application in healthcare and human enhancement. Finally, we critically assess the possible futures of neural interfacing and analyze the short- and long-term implications of such neurotechnologies.}

Here, we designed a simple yet robust EEG data quality metric assessing the percentage of significant channels between two experimental conditions within a 100 ms post-stimulus time range. Because of volume conduction in EEG, given no noise, most brain-evoked related potentials (ERP) should be visible on every single channel. Using three publicly available collections of EEG data, we showed that, with the exceptions of high-pass filtering and bad channel interpolation, automated data corrections had no effect on or significantly decreased the percentage of significant channels. Referencing and advanced baseline removal methods were significantly detrimental to performance. Rejecting bad data segments or trials could not compensate for the loss in statistical power. Automated Independent Component Analysis rejection of eyes and muscles failed to increase performance reliably. We compared optimized pipelines for preprocessing EEG data maximizing ERP significance using the leading open-source EEG software: EEGLAB, FieldTrip, MNE, and Brainstorm. Only one pipeline performed significantly better than high-pass filtering the data.},

abstract="The goal of this paper is to use a brain-computer interface (BCI) and artificial intelligence for EEG signal analysis. This includes answering the question whether it is possible to create a classifier that could correctly recognize emotions from EEG data recorded by simple and cheap equipment. In the paper, we compared the created classifier with the one that was taught on high-quality EEG data, which was recorded with the help of professional-grade equipment. Two experiments were planned. In both experiments, models had to classify three emotions based on EEG data: positive, negative, and neutral. In the first one, a classifier was trained on data from every person in a group and then tested on the data from the same group of people. In the second test, a classifier was trained on data from a group of people and then tested on a person from outside of this group. From the results of the conducted experiments, an appropriate set of conclusions were drawn. It is possible to create a classifier on a lower grade dataset. The best classifier made on the Mindwave dataset had a prediction accuracy of 89{\%}. The classifier made on the lower grade dataset presented worse results than the classifier made on high-grade dataset. The difference in prediction accuracy between both classifiers is 10{\%}. Classifiers tested on one set of people could not accurately predict the emotions of people outside of this group. The conclusions were consistent with related works results.",

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. APPROACH We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. MAIN RESULTS We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. SIGNIFICANCE This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.},

abstract = {The K-complex is one of the most important and noticeable features in the electroencephalography (EEG) signal, therefore its detection is critical for EEG signal analysis. It is used to diagnose neurophysiologic and cognitive disorders as well as sleep studies. Existing detection methods largely depend on tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone manual inspection of the EEG waveform. In this paper, a highly accurate K-complex detection system is developed. Based on multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) feature extraction backbones and EEG waveform images, you only look once v3 (YOLOv3) detector was designed, trained, and tested. Extensive performance evaluation was performed using five deep transfer learning feature extraction models; Darknet-53, MobileNets, ResNet-18, SqueezeNet, and Darknet-53-coco. The dataset was comprised of 10948 images of EEG waveforms, with the K-complex location automatically annotated with bounding boxes. The Darknet-53 model performed consistently high (i.e., 89.84–99.44% precision and 10.41–0.55% miss rate). Thus, it is possible to perform automatic K-complex detection in real-time with high accuracy that aid practitioners in speedy EEG inspection.},

The goal of BCI is to achieve a prototype that supports disabled people to develop the relevant function. Various studies have been implemented in the literature to achieve a superior design using multi-channel EEG signals. This paper proposed a novel framework for the automatic P300 detection-based BCI model using a single EEG electrode. In the present study, we introduced a denoising approach using the bandpass filter technique followed by the transformation of scalogram images using continuous wavelet transform. The derived images were trained and validated using a deep neural network based on the transfer learning approach. This paper presents a BCI model based on the deep network that delivers higher performance in terms of classification accuracy and bitrate for disabled subjects using a single-channel EEG signal. The proposed P300 based BCI model has the highest average information transfer rates of 13.23 to 26.48 bits/min for disabled subjects. The classification performance has shown that the deep network based on the transfer learning approach can offer comparable performance with other state-of-the-art-method.},

Here, we demonstrate the first speech-to-text BCI that records spiking activity from intracortical microelectrode arrays. Enabled by these high-resolution recordings, our study participant, who can no longer speak intelligibly due amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), achieved a 9.1\% word error rate on a 50 word vocabulary (2.7 times fewer errors than the prior state of the art speech BCI2) and a 23.8\% word error rate on a 125,000 word vocabulary (the first successful demonstration of large-vocabulary decoding). Our BCI decoded speech at 62 words per minute, which is 3.4 times faster than the prior record for any kind of BCI6 and begins to approach the speed of natural conversation (160 words per minute7). Finally, we highlight two aspects of the neural code for speech that are encouraging for speech BCIs: spatially intermixed tuning to speech articulators that makes accurate decoding possible from only a small region of cortex, and a detailed articulatory representation of phonemes that persists years after paralysis. These results show a feasible path forward for using intracortical speech BCIs to restore rapid communication to people with paralysis who can no longer speak.Competing Interest StatementThe MGH Translational Research Center has a clinical research support agreement with Neuralink, Paradromics and Synchron, for which L.R.H. provides consultative input.

abstract = {Deep learning (DL), a branch of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is nowadays considered as a core technology of today's Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0). Due to its learning capabilities from data, DL technology originated from artificial neural network (ANN), has become a hot topic in the context of computing, and is widely applied in various application areas like healthcare, visual recognition, text analytics, cybersecurity, and many more. However, building an appropriate DL model is a challenging task, due to the dynamic nature and variations in real-world problems and data. Moreover, the lack of core understanding turns DL methods into black-box machines that hamper development at the standard level. This article presents a structured and comprehensive view on DL techniques including a taxonomy considering various types of real-world tasks like supervised or unsupervised. In our taxonomy, we take into account deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning, unsupervised or generative learning as well as hybrid learning and relevant others. We also summarize real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be used. Finally, we point out ten potential aspects for future generation DL modeling with research directions. Overall, this article aims to draw a big picture on DL modeling that can be used as a reference guide for both academia and industry professionals.},

Deep learning approaches have been used successfully in many recent studies to learn features and classify different types of data. However, the number of studies that employ these approaches on BCI applications is very limited. In this study we aim to use deep learning methods to improve classification performance of EEG motor imagery signals. Approach. In this study we investigate convolutional neural networks (CNN) and stacked autoencoders (SAE) to classify EEG Motor Imagery signals. A new form of input is introduced to combine time, frequency and location information extracted from EEG signal and it is used in CNN having one 1D convolutional and one max-pooling layers. We also proposed a new deep network by combining CNN and SAE. In this network, the features that are extracted in CNN are classified through the deep network SAE. Main results. The classification performance obtained by the proposed method on BCI competition IV dataset 2b in terms of kappa value is 0.547. Our approach yields 9% improvement over the winner algorithm of the competition. Significance. Our results show that deep learning methods provide better classification performance compared to other state of art approaches. These methods can be applied successfully to BCI systems where the amount of data is large due to daily recording.}

	abstract = {Objective. Brain–computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct communication with a computer, using neural activity as the control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition to perform automatic feature extraction and classification, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being as compact as possible. Approach. In this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI. We compare EEGNet, both for within-subject and cross-subject classification, to current state-of-the-art approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR). Main results. We show that EEGNet generalizes across paradigms better than, and achieves comparably high performance to, the reference algorithms when only limited training data is available across all tested paradigms. In addition, we demonstrate three different approaches to visualize the contents of a trained EEGNet model to enable interpretation of the learned features. Significance. Our results suggest that EEGNet is robust enough to learn a wide variety of interpretable features over a range of BCI tasks. Our models can be found at: https://github.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels.}

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease, is characterized by the degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons, which leads to muscle weakness and subsequently paralysis. It begins subtly with focal weakness but spreads relentlessly to involve most muscles, thus proving to be effectively incurable. Typically, death due to respiratory paralysis occurs in 3–5 years. To date, it has been shown that the management of ALS patients is best achieved with a multidisciplinary approach, and with the help of emerging technologies ranging from multidisciplinary teleconsults (for monitoring the dysphagia, respiratory function, and nutritional status) to brain-computer interfaces and eye tracking for alternative augmentative communication, until robotics, it may increase effectiveness. The COVID-19 pandemic created a spasmodic need to accelerate the development and implementation of such technologies in clinical practice, to improve the daily lives of both ALS patients and caregivers. However, despite the remarkable strides that have been made in the field, there are still issues to be addressed. This review will be discussed on the eureka moment of emerging technologies for ALS, used as a blueprint not only for neurodegenerative diseases, examining the current technologies already in place or being evaluated, highlighting the pros and cons for future clinical applications.},

@article{Ajiboye.2017,
abstract = {Background People with chronic tetraplegia, due to high-cervical spinal cord injury, can regain limb movements through coordinated electrical stimulation of peripheral muscles and nerves, known as functional electrical stimulation (FES). Users typically command FES systems through other preserved, but unrelated and limited in number, volitional movements (eg, facial muscle activity, head movements, shoulder shrugs). We report the findings of an individual with traumatic high-cervical spinal cord injury who coordinated reaching and grasping movements using his own paralysed arm and hand, reanimated through implanted FES, and commanded using his own cortical signals through an intracortical brain–computer interface (iBCI). Methods We recruited a participant into the BrainGate2 clinical trial, an ongoing study that obtains safety information regarding an intracortical neural interface device, and investigates the feasibility of people with tetraplegia controlling assistive devices using their cortical signals. Surgical procedures were performed at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). Study procedures and data analyses were performed at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH, USA) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs, Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). The study participant was a 53-year-old man with a spinal cord injury (cervical level 4, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale category A). He received two intracortical microelectrode arrays in the hand area of his motor cortex, and 4 months and 9 months later received a total of 36 implanted percutaneous electrodes in his right upper and lower arm to electrically stimulate his hand, elbow, and shoulder muscles. The participant used a motorised mobile arm support for gravitational assistance and to provide humeral abduction and adduction under cortical control. We assessed the participant's ability to cortically command his paralysed arm to perform simple single-joint arm and hand movements and functionally meaningful multi-joint movements. We compared iBCI control of his paralysed arm with that of a virtual three-dimensional arm. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00912041. Findings The intracortical implant occurred on Dec 1, 2014, and we are continuing to study the participant. The last session included in this report was Nov 7, 2016. The point-to-point target acquisition sessions began on Oct 8, 2015 (311 days after implant). The participant successfully cortically commanded single-joint and coordinated multi-joint arm movements for point-to-point target acquisitions (80–100% accuracy), using first a virtual arm and second his own arm animated by FES. Using his paralysed arm, the participant volitionally performed self-paced reaches to drink a mug of coffee (successfully completing 11 of 12 attempts within a single session 463 days after implant) and feed himself (717 days after implant). Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first report of a combined implanted FES+iBCI neuroprosthesis for restoring both reaching and grasping movements to people with chronic tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury, and represents a major advance, with a clear translational path, for clinically viable neuroprostheses for restoration of reaching and grasping after paralysis.

abstract="Nowadays, machine and deep learning techniques are widely used in different areas, ranging from economics to biology. In general, these techniques can be used in two ways: trying to adapt well-known models and architectures to the available data, or designing custom architectures. In both cases, to speed up the research process, it is useful to know which type of models work best for a specific problem and/or data type. By focusing on EEG signal analysis, and for the first time in literature, in this paper a benchmark of machine and deep learning for EEG signal classification is proposed. For our experiments we used the four most widespread models, i.e., multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent unit, highlighting which one can be a good starting point for developing EEG classification models.",

abstract = {There is growing awareness across the neuroscience community that the replicability of findings about the relationship between brain activity and cognitive phenomena can be improved by conducting studies with high statistical power that adhere to well-defined and standardised analysis pipelines. Inspired by recent efforts from the psychological sciences, and with the desire to examine some of the foundational findings using electroencephalography (EEG), we have launched #EEGManyLabs, a large-scale international collaborative replication effort. Since its discovery in the early 20th century, EEG has had a profound influence on our understanding of human cognition, but there is limited evidence on the replicability of some of the most highly cited discoveries. After a systematic search and selection process, we have identified 27 of the most influential and continually cited studies in the field. We plan to directly test the replicability of key findings from 20 of these studies in teams of at least three independent laboratories. The design and protocol of each replication effort will be submitted as a Registered Report and peer-reviewed prior to data collection. Prediction markets, open to all EEG researchers, will be used as a forecasting tool to examine which findings the community expects to replicate. This project will update our confidence in some of the most influential EEG findings and generate a large open access database that can be used to inform future research practices. Finally, through this international effort, we hope to create a cultural shift towards inclusive, high-powered multi-laboratory collaborations.}

abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The present paper gives detailed information about the MNE package and describes typical use cases while also warning about potential caveats in analysis.

ABSTRACT = {Over the last few decades, the Brain-Computer Interfaces have been gradually making their way to the epicenter of scientific interest. Many scientists from all around the world have contributed to the state of the art in this scientific domain by developing numerous tools and methods for brain signal acquisition and processing. Such a spectacular progress would not be achievable without accompanying technological development to equip the researchers with the proper devices providing what is absolutely necessary for any kind of discovery as the core of every analysis: the data reflecting the brain activity. The common effort has resulted in pushing the whole domain to the point where the communication between a human being and the external world through BCI interfaces is no longer science fiction but nowadays reality. In this work we present the most relevant aspects of the BCIs and all the milestones that have been made over nearly 50-year history of this research domain. We mention people who were pioneers in this area as well as we highlight all the technological and methodological advances that have transformed something available and understandable by a very few into something that has a potential to be a breathtaking change for so many. Aiming to fully understand how the human brain works is a very ambitious goal and it will surely take time to succeed. However, even that fraction of what has already been determined is sufficient e.g., to allow impaired people to regain control on their lives and significantly improve its quality. The more is discovered in this domain, the more benefit for all of us this can potentially bring.},

	abstract = {Objective. Brain–computer interface (BCI) systems decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to establish a channel for direct interaction between the human brain and the external world without the need for muscle or nerve control. The P300 speller, one of the most widely used BCI applications, presents a selection of characters to the user and performs character recognition by identifying P300 event-related potentials from the EEG. Such P300-based BCI systems can reach good levels of accuracy but are difficult to use in day-to-day life due to redundancy and noisy signal. A room for improvement should be considered. We propose a novel hybrid feature selection method for the P300-based BCI system to address the problem of feature redundancy, which combines the Menger curvature and linear discriminant analysis. Approach. First, selected strategies are applied separately to a given dataset to estimate the gain for application to each feature. Then, each generated value set is ranked in descending order and judged by a predefined criterion to be suitable in classification models. The intersection of the two approaches is then evaluated to identify an optimal feature subset. Main results. The proposed method is evaluated using three public datasets, i.e. BCI Competition III dataset II, brain/neural computer interaction Horizon dataset, and Lausanne Federal Institute of Technology dataset. Experimental results indicate that compared with other typical feature selection and classification methods, our proposed method has better or comparable performance. Significance. Additionally, our proposed method can achieve the best classification accuracy after all epochs in three datasets. In summary, our proposed method provides a new way to enhance the performance of the P300-based BCI speller.}

Most studies so far focused on making EEG-based BCI spellers faster and more reliable; however, few have considered their security. This study, for the first time, shows that P300 and steady-state visual evoked potential BCI spellers are very vulnerable, i.e. they can be severely attacked by adversarial perturbations, which are too tiny to be noticed when added to EEG signals, but can mislead the spellers to spell anything the attacker wants. The consequence could range from merely user frustration to severe misdiagnosis in clinical applications. We hope our research can attract more attention to the security of EEG-based BCI spellers, and more broadly, EEG-based BCIs, which has received little attention before.}",

The convolutional neural network (CNN) is an approach that has achieved good P300 detection performances. However, the standard CNN may be prone to overfitting and the convergence may be slow. To address these issues, we develop a novel CNN, termed BN3, for detecting P300 signals, where Batch Normalization is introduced in the input and convolutional layers to alleviate over-fitting, and the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is employed in the convolutional layers to accelerate training. Since our model is fully data-driven, it is capable of automatically capturing the discriminative spatio-temporal features of the P300 signal. The results obtained on previous BCI competition P300 data sets show that BN3 both achieves the state-of-the-art character recognition performance and that it outperforms existing detection approaches with small flashing epoch numbers. BN3 can be used to improve the character recognition performance in P300 speller systems.}

  abstract = {This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The primary focus is on the theory and algorithms of deep learning. The theory and algorithms of neural networks are particularly important for understanding important concepts, so that one can understand the important design concepts of neural architectures in different applications. Why do neural networks work? When do they work better than off-the-shelf machine-learning models? When is depth useful? Why is training neural networks so hard? What are the pitfalls? The book is also rich in discussing different applications in order to give the practitioner a flavor of how neural architectures are designed for different types of problems. Applications associated with many different areas like recommender systems, machine translation, image captioning, image classification, reinforcement-learning based gaming, and text analytics are covered. The chapters of this book span three categories. First, the basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. The second part deals with Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. The final part covers Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and 8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10.},

ABSTRACT={The analysis of Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is of ulterior importance to aid in the diagnosis of mental disease and to increase our understanding of the brain. Traditionally, clinical EEG has been analyzed in terms of temporal waveforms, looking at rhythms in spontaneous activity, subjectively identifying troughs and peaks in Event-Related Potentials (ERP), or by studying graphoelements in pathological sleep stages. Additionally, the discipline of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) requires new methods to decode patterns from non-invasive EEG signals. This field is developing alternative communication pathways to transmit volitional information from the Central Nervous System. The technology could potentially enhance the quality of life of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders and other mental illness. This work mimics what electroencephalographers have been doing clinically, visually inspecting, and categorizing phenomena within the EEG by the extraction of features from images of signal plots. These features are constructed based on the calculation of histograms of oriented gradients from pixels around the signal plot. It aims to provide a new objective framework to analyze, characterize and classify EEG signal waveforms. The feasibility of the method is outlined by detecting the P300, an ERP elicited by the oddball paradigm of rare events, and implementing an offline P300-based BCI Speller. The validity of the proposal is shown by offline processing a public dataset of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and an own dataset of healthy subjects.}

ABSTRACT={Brain computer interfaces rely on machine learning (ML) algorithms to decode the brain's electrical activity into decisions. For example, in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks, the subject is presented with a continuous stream of images containing rare target images among standard images, while the algorithm has to detect brain activity associated with target images. Here, we continue our previous work, presenting a deep neural network model for the use of single trial EEG classification in RSVP tasks. Deep neural networks have shown state of the art performance in computer vision and speech recognition and thus have great promise for other learning tasks, like classification of EEG samples. In our model, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal regularization for EEG data to reduce overfitting. We show improved classification performance compared to our earlier work on a five categories RSVP experiment. In addition, we compare performance on data from different sessions and validate the model on a public benchmark data set of a P300 speller task. Finally, we discuss the advantages of using neural network models compared to manually designing feature extraction algorithms.}

  abstract  = "In the last fifteen years, a recognizable surge in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research and development has emerged. This emergence has sprung from a variety of factors. For one, inexpensive computer hardware and software is now available and can support the complex high-speed analyses of brain activity that is essential is BCI. Another factor is the greater understanding of the central nervous system, including the abundance of new information on the nature and functional correlates of brain signals and improved methods for recording these signals in both the short-term and long-term. And the third, and perhaps most significant factor, is the new recognition of the needs and abilities of people disabled by disorders such as cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophies. The severely disabled are now able to live for many years and even those with severely limited voluntary muscle control can now be given the most basic means of communication and control because of the recent advances in the technology, research, and applications of BCI.",

abstract = {For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world – a brain–computer interface (BCI). Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or ‘locked in’, with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10–25bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.}

abstract = {Objectives Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, restricts patients’ communication capacity a few years after onset. A proof-of-concept of brain–computer interface (BCI) has shown promise in ALS and “locked-in” patients, mostly in pre-clinical studies or with only a few patients, but performance was estimated not high enough to support adoption by people with physical limitation of speech. Here, we evaluated a visual BCI device in a clinical study to determine whether disabled people with multiple deficiencies related to ALS would be able to use BCI to communicate in a daily environment. Methods After clinical evaluation of physical, cognitive and language capacities, 20 patients with ALS were included. The P300 speller BCI system consisted of electroencephalography acquisition connected to real-time processing software and separate keyboard-display control software. It was equipped with original features such as optimal stopping of flashes and word prediction. The study consisted of two 3-block sessions (copy spelling, free spelling and free use) with the system in several modes of operation to evaluate its usability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. Results The system was effective in that all participants successfully achieved all spelling tasks and was efficient in that 65\% of participants selected more than 95\% of the correct symbols. The mean number of correct symbols selected per minute ranged from 3.6 (without word prediction) to 5.04 (with word prediction). Participants expressed satisfaction: the mean score was 8.7 on a 10-point visual analog scale assessing comfort, ease of use and utility. Patients quickly learned how to operate the system, which did not require much learning effort. Conclusion With its word prediction and optimal stopping of flashes, which improves information transfer rate, the BCI system may be competitive with alternative communication systems such as eye-trackers. Remaining requirements to improve the device for suitable ergonomic use are in progress.}

ABSTRACT={Drowsiness is a leading cause of traffic and industrial accidents, costing lives and productivity. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals can reflect awareness and attentiveness, and low-cost consumer EEG headsets are available on the market. The use of these devices as drowsiness detectors could increase the accessibility of safety and productivity-enhancing devices for small businesses and developing countries. We conducted a systemic review of currently available, low-cost, consumer EEG-based drowsiness detection systems. We sought to determine whether consumer EEG headsets could be reliably utilized as rudimentary drowsiness detection systems. We included documented cases describing successful drowsiness detection using consumer EEG-based devices, including the Neurosky MindWave, InteraXon Muse, Emotiv Epoc, Emotiv Insight, and OpenBCI. Of 46 relevant studies, ~27 reported an accuracy score. The lowest of these was the Neurosky Mindwave, with a minimum of 31%. The second lowest accuracy reported was 79.4% with an OpenBCI study. In many cases, algorithmic optimization remains necessary. Different methods for accuracy calculation, system calibration, and different definitions of drowsiness made direct comparisons problematic. However, even basic features, such as the power spectra of EEG bands, were able to consistently detect drowsiness. Each specific device has its own capabilities, tradeoffs, and limitations. Widely used spectral features can achieve successful drowsiness detection, even with low-cost consumer devices; however, reliability issues must still be addressed in an occupational context.}

ABSTRACT={Electroencephalography (EEG) is increasingly used for repetitive and prolonged applications like neurofeedback, brain computer interfacing, and long-term intermittent monitoring. Dry-contact electrodes enable rapid self-application. A common drawback of existing dry electrodes is the limited wearing comfort during prolonged application. We propose a novel dry Arch electrode. Five semi-circular arches are arranged parallelly on a common baseplate. The electrode substrate material is a flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) produced by additive manufacturing. A chemical coating of Silver/Silver-Chloride (Ag/AgCl) is applied by electroless plating using a novel surface functionalization method. Arch electrodes were manufactured and validated in terms of mechanical durability, electrochemical stability, in vivo applicability, and signal characteristics. We compare the results of the dry arch electrodes with dry pin-shaped and conventional gel-based electrodes. 21-channel EEG recordings were acquired on 10 male and 5 female volunteers. The tests included resting state EEG, alpha activity, and a visual evoked potential. Wearing comfort was rated by the subjects directly after application, as well as at 30 min and 60 min of wearing. Our results show that the novel plating technique provides a well-adhering electrically conductive and electrochemically stable coating, withstanding repetitive strain and bending tests. The signal quality of the Arch electrodes is comparable to pin-shaped dry electrodes. The average channel reliability of the Arch electrode setup was 91.9 ± 9.5%. No considerable differences in signal characteristics have been observed for the gel-based, dry pin-shaped, and arch-shaped electrodes after the identification and exclusion of bad channels. The comfort was improved in comparison to pin-shaped electrodes and enabled applications of over 60 min duration. Arch electrodes required individual adaptation of the electrodes to the orientation and hairstyle of the volunteers. This initial preparation time of the 21-channel cap increased from an average of 5 min for pin-like electrodes to 15 min for Arch electrodes and 22 min for gel-based electrodes. However, when re-applying the arch electrode cap on the same volunteer, preparation times of pin-shaped and arch-shaped electrodes were comparable. In summary, our results indicate the applicability of the novel Arch electrode and coating for EEG acquisition. The novel electrode enables increased comfort for prolonged dry-contact measurement.}

              cannot use any motor system for communication (e.g., 'locked-in'
              patients). The 26 letters of the alphabet, together with several
              other symbols and commands, are displayed on a computer screen
              which serves as the keyboard or prosthetic device. The subject
              focuses attention successively on the characters he wishes to
              communicate. The computer detects the chosen character on-line
              and in real time. This detection is achieved by repeatedly
              flashing rows and columns of the matrix. When the elements
              containing the chosen character are flashed, a P300 is elicited,
              and it is this P300 that is detected by the computer. We report
              an analysis of the operating characteristics of the system when
              used with normal volunteers, who took part in 2 experimental
              sessions. In the first session (the pilot study/training session)

              specific number of trials while data were recorded for off-line

We present the insights gained and guidelines established within the EEG working group of the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND). CAN-BIND is a multi-site, multi-investigator, and multi-project network supported by the Ontario Brain Institute with access to Brain-CODE, an informatics platform that hosts a multitude of biological data across a growing list of brain pathologies. We describe our approaches and insights on documenting and standardizing parameters across the study design, data collection, monitoring, analysis, integration, knowledge-translation, and data archiving phases of CAN-BIND projects. We introduce a custom-built EEG toolbox to track data preprocessing with open-access for the scientific community. We also evaluate the impact of variation in equipment setup on the accuracy of acquired data.

Unlike noninvasive BCI that have a lower spatial resolution, invasive BCI have the potential to record the activity of single neurons. The clinical long-term aim of these interfaces has always been to allow severely paralyzed individuals to regain some autonomy and to increase their quality of life. In recent years, several groups could show that complex movements, with multiple degrees of freedom, can be decoded from the recorded brain signals. At the same time, this technology has also made it possible to “peek” into living and intact human brains on a single neuron level while the person is thinking and acting. In the near future, we will have an increasing amount of neuronal recordings from humans, which will allow valuable new insights into the living human brain. In this chapter, we will discuss current BCI methodology and state-of-the-art advances in the field of human neural recordings.}

abstract={This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

ABSTRACT={The purpose of this study was to investigate the support of attentional and memory processes in controlling a P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Eight people with ALS performed two behavioral tasks: (i) a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, screening the temporal filtering capacity and the speed of the update of the attentive filter, and (ii) a change detection task, screening the memory capacity and the spatial filtering capacity. The participants were also asked to perform a P300-based BCI spelling task. By using correlation and regression analyses, we found that only the temporal filtering capacity in the RSVP task was a predictor of both the P300-based BCI accuracy and of the amplitude of the P300 elicited performing the BCI task. We concluded that the ability to keep the attentional filter active during the selection of a target influences performance in BCI control.}

abstract = {This book is aimed to provide an overview of general deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information processing tasks. The application areas are chosen with the following three criteria: 1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; 2) the application areas that have already been transformed by the successful use of deep learning technology, such as speech recognition and computer vision; and 3) the application areas that have the potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and that have gained concentrated research efforts, including natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information processing empowered by multi-task deep learning.

In Chapter 1, we provide the background of deep learning, as intrinsically connected to the use of multiple layers of nonlinear transformations to derive features from the sensory signals such as speech and visual images. In the most recent literature, deep learning is embodied also as representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level representations of them are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level representations help to define higher-level ones. In Chapter 2, a brief historical account of deep learning is presented. In particular, selected chronological development of speech recognition is used to illustrate the recent impact of deep learning that has become a dominant technology in speech recognition industry within only a few years since the start of a collaboration between academic and industrial researchers in applying deep learning to speech recognition. In Chapter 3, a three-way classification scheme for a large body of work in deep learning is developed. We classify a growing number of deep learning techniques into unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid categories, and present qualitative descriptions and a literature survey for each category. From Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we discuss in detail three popular deep networks and related learning methods, one in each category. Chapter 4 is devoted to deep autoencoders as a prominent example of the unsupervised deep learning techniques. Chapter 5 gives a major example in the hybrid deep network category, which is the discriminative feed-forward neural network for supervised learning with many layers initialized using layer-by-layer generative, unsupervised pre-training. In Chapter 6, deep stacking networks and several of the variants are discussed in detail, which exemplify the discriminative or supervised deep learning techniques in the three-way categorization scheme.

In Chapters 7-11, we select a set of typical and successful applications of deep learning in diverse areas of signal and information processing and of applied artificial intelligence. In Chapter 7, we review the applications of deep learning to speech and audio processing, with emphasis on speech recognition organized according to several prominent themes. In Chapters 8, we present recent results of applying deep learning to language modeling and natural language processing. Chapter 9 is devoted to selected applications of deep learning to information retrieval including Web search. In Chapter 10, we cover selected applications of deep learning to image object recognition in computer vision. Selected applications of deep learning to multi-modal processing and multi-task learning are reviewed in Chapter 11. Finally, an epilogue is given in Chapter 12 to summarize what we presented in earlier chapters and to discuss future challenges and directions.},

abstract = {Human languages encode similar average information rates (~39 bits/s) despite their remarkable differences. Language is universal, but it has few indisputably universal characteristics, with cross-linguistic variation being the norm. For example, languages differ greatly in the number of syllables they allow, resulting in large variation in the Shannon information per syllable. Nevertheless, all natural languages allow their speakers to efficiently encode and transmit information. We show here, using quantitative methods on a large cross-linguistic corpus of 17 languages, that the coupling between language-level (information per syllable) and speaker-level (speech rate) properties results in languages encoding similar information rates (~39 bits/s) despite wide differences in each property individually: Languages are more similar in information rates than in Shannon information or speech rate. These findings highlight the intimate feedback loops between languages’ structural properties and their speakers’ neurocognition and biology under communicative pressures. Thus, language is the product of a multiscale communicative niche construction process at the intersection of biology, environment, and culture.}

The design of the proposed system is based on receiving, processing, and classification of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and then performing the control of the wheelchair. The number of experimental measurements of brain activity has been done using human control commands of the wheelchair. Based on the mental activity of the user and the control commands of the wheelchair, the design of classification system based on fuzzy neural networks (FNN) is considered. The design of FNN based algorithm is used for brain-actuated control. The training data is used to design the system and then test data is applied to measure the performance of the control system. The control of the wheelchair is performed under real conditions using direction and speed control commands of the wheelchair. The approach used in the paper allows reducing the probability of misclassification and improving the control accuracy of the wheelchair.},
